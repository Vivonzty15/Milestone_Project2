### Issues
#### Working as a team being in constant communication is key. We do run into a merge issues with our branches.
### What we learned:
- When working as a team, make sure to work in the latest version of the repository.
- git pull origin main it is a must, so you do not override the previous work of your team.
- ![Image Updating the repository](https://github.com/Vivonzty15/Milestone_Project2/blob/main/Images/git%20pull%20origin%20main.png)
- Connecting the Front-End with Back-End.
- Running Back-end and Front-end syncronized.
- Score in our questions

### Work In Progress
- The original idea was to do a trivia game with social media included, the social profile part of the game is a work in process.
- Add profile tab and login screen to game and have the ability to chat with others and answer questions together.
- Edit add question form to allow adding answers to the question. There is currently a text placeholder for question review.
- When viewing questions if you change the email address in the search bar the first question entry does not update.
- Question answers are currently not random and the correct answer is always "A". Working on randomizing answers array.
- Clean up code and remove unnecessary files.
