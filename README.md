### Issues
#### While working as a team, being in constant communication is key. We did run into a merge issues with our branches.
### What we learned:
- When working as a team, make sure to work in the latest version of the repository.
- Connecting the Front-End with Back-End.
- Running Back-end and Front-end syncronized.
- Couldn't get the answers to shuffle.
- We need to clean up the repository and remove unnecessary files.
